# Install and config pfSense for one-node infrastructure and access it from anywhere with DDNS on Cloudflare

## One-node infrastructure

Having a single, beefy server can be a problem sometimes. We needed a fleet of virtual servers for various applications and tests and the posibility to access each server separatly from anywhere. In order to do this we need a router for all of them, but because this is a home setup and we only have a single physical machine for thit, the only viable solution is to have a virtual router and that will be pfSense


## The solution

We came up with a solution that uses various technologies from the virtualization world. A few
key points must be met:
- Server
- Capable hypervisor
- pfSense in VM
 
## The server

Our machine is a Dell PowerEdge R420 with the following relevant specifications:

- 2x Intel Xeon E5-2420 1.9 Ghz, 8 cores
- 8x 16GB ECC RAM
- 2x 500GB SSD
- 2x Gigabit NICs

## The hypervisor

There are various hypervisors capable of doing what we needed, like Proxmox, ovirt, KVM, Hyper-V, ESXi etc. We opted for KVM on Ubuntu because it's stable and it's free.

## Networking

Our ISP requires PPPoE authentication, and at each reconnect, our public IP changes. We needed a router for the VMs and for the office, but we first need to take care of the network virtualization part. We created networks, called VM Network and WAN.

- VM Network - this is the equivalent of LAN. All VMs will be connected to this network.
- WAN - our ISP


## Prerequisites before installing pfSense

In order to have good performance with the virtual router the VM should have enough resources. We chose next specs

- 4 CPUs
- 8 GB RAM
- 10 GB storage

##### First make sure you have root access
	sudo su -

Now go to [pfsense](https://www.pfsense.org/download/) website and download the image from there. Select the Architecture: AMD64(64-bit) and Installer: CD image (ISO) Installer
 or simply download it with next command

	wget https://nyifiles.pfsense.org/mirror/downloads/pfSense-CE-2.4.5-RELEASE-amd64.iso.gz


![enter image description here](https://github.com/sjultra/Guides/blob/main/pfSense_install_one-node_infrastructure/images/1.png?raw=true)
<br/>
Unzip the archive you just download either way

	gunzip pfSense-CE-2.4.5-RELEASE-amd64.iso.gz
	
<br/>

#### Install KVM and bridge-utils to set up the VMs and network


	apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system bridge-utils virt-manager
<br/>
Set up the network creating the bridges. Like we said earlier we need 2 networks so we have to create 2 network bridges on the server. In the bridge virbr0 we will add the interface connected to the ISP line and the other bridge, virbr1 will be used for future VM's created in our one-node infrastructure.

	brctl addbr virbr0 && brctl addbr virbr1
<br/>

Add the inteface conected to ISP line to virbr0. In our case the interface name was eno1

	brctl addif eno1 virbr0
	
<br/>

To have your things a little in order let's create a folder for your VM disk's called vmdisks
	
	mkdir vmdisks
<br/>
If you are not directly at the console of the server but connected through ssh connection make sure you use -X argument when connecting so you can directly see VM console. If this does not work for you then you will have to connect with a VNC viewer to VM's console

	ssh -X user@host
<br/>

Create the VM named pfsense with next comand

	sudo virt-install --name pfsense --ram 8048 --disk path=./vmdisks/pfsense.qcow2,size=10 --vcpus 4 --os-type linux --os-variant generic --network bridge=virbr0 --network bridge=virbr1 --graphics vnc --console pty,target_type=serial --cdrom 'pfSense-CE-2.4.5-RELEASE-amd64.iso'

<br/>
The VM it's created and a welcome screen should appear. You can hit Enter

Select the No

![enter image description here](https://github.com/sjultra/Guides/blob/main/pfSense_install_one-node_infrastructure/images/7.png?raw=true)

Press Enter to reboot the VM

![enter image description here](https://github.com/sjultra/Guides/blob/main/pfSense_install_one-node_infrastructure/images/8.png?raw=true)


After rebooting, will ask if you need to configure VLANs. We do not have VLANs so hit n

Next the system will try to detect the list of available network interfaces.
The system will ask you to choose 1 interface as the external interface [WAN] and 1 for [LAN].  In our example we have em0 for WAN and em1 for LAN
